# Fake News Detection Through Artificial Intelligence (Machine Learning)
## A fake news detector in portuguese with the Machine Learning algorithm Support Vector Machine


This project is for my final assessment at my high school, with the goal to understand how a fake news is created and propagated (with the use of linguistics) and how can be built artificial intelligences to solve this kind of problem, in a more cheap and fastway.

The database used was Fake.Br Corpus, from [this](https://github.com/roneysco/Fake.br-Corpus) github repo, which is the most used nowadays for researches with fake news detection (in the portuguese language). With [this](https://repositorio.unesp.br/bitstream/handle/11449/242304/garcia_gl_me_bauru.pdf?sequence=3&isAllowed=y) paper as a guide, I decided to use the Support Vector Machine algorithm, a very easy algorithm to use and not too complex for my goals.


### To Do

 - [ ] Import the necessary libraries (for machine learning, data manipulation, etc.)
 - [ ] Download and load the Fake.Br Corpus dataset
 - [ ] Split the data into training and test samples
 - [ ] Train the SVM model into the dataset
 - [ ] Test the model with the test sample
 - [ ] Test with known news at Brazil
